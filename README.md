The File Organizer Application is a simple Java program that lets you create, manage, and display files and folders in a tree structure. It allows you to add files or folders to a parent directory or the root and shows the full structure in a hierarchical fashion.

This application was intended to learn constructing tree data structures and recursion in Java, which simulates how real-world file systems work. It teaches beginners about hierarchical data management and serves as the foundation for more advanced programs such as content management systems and virtual file organizers.
