The File Organizer Application is a simple Java program that lets you create, manage, and display files and folders in a tree structure. It allows you to add files or folders to a parent directory or the root and shows the full structure in a hierarchical fashion.

This application was intended to learn constructing tree data structures and recursion in Java, which simulates how real-world file systems work. It teaches beginners about hierarchical data management and serves as the foundation for more advanced programs such as content management systems and virtual file organizers.


The Inventory Management System is a Java-based console application that uses Multi-Way B-trees to organize product names alphabetically and Min-Heaps to track the product with the lowest inventory. It allows users to add products, search for them, arrange all products alphabetically, and locate the product with the lowest supply. This application was made to demonstrate the actual application of efficient data structures for inventory management, with the goal of simplifying and streamlining stock management for small enterprises and education. It helps the community by providing an educational tool for understanding data structures and an efficient inventory management system.

Introduction: 
The Product Price Lookup application is a simple Java console-based program designed to help users manage and retrieve product prices efficiently. It uses a Hash and HashTable data structure to store product names and their respective prices, ensuring fast lookups, and additions.

Features:
 	1. View All Products: Displays a list of all available products without showing their prices.
 	2. Add New Products: Allows users to add new products along with their prices in Peso currency.
 	3. Price Lookup: Enables users to search for the price of a specific product by entering its name. The application is case-insensitive for product names, making it user-friendly.

Purpose:
The purpose of this application is to provide a simple, efficient tool for managing and retrieving product prices, while helping me strengthen my Java programming skills.

Contribution to the Community:
It contributes to the community by offering an accessible solution for small businesses and beginners, enabling them to easily track product prices and learn basic programming concepts.

Introduction:
The Friend Suggestion System is a social network simulation application that uses a graph-based structure to model relationships between users. In this system, users are represented as nodes, and friendships are modeled as edges between those nodes.

Features:
	1. Add users
	2. Create Friendships
	3. Suggest Friends
	4. Display the Friend Graph

Why Did You Make This Application?
I created this application to better understand graph data structures and algorithms, specifically for modeling relationships and implementing friend suggestions. It allowed me to practice problem-solving and enhance my programming skills.

How Does It Contribute to You or the Community?
It contributed to my personal growth by improving my skills in data structures and algorithms. For the community, it serves as an educational tool for learning graph theory and inspires others to build similar applications.
